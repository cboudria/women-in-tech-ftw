                <div class="title">Ada Lovelace (1815-1852)</div>
                <div class="content">
                <p>At 26, encouraged by her husband, Lovelace returned to assisting her friend and mentor Charles Babbage, known as the father of the computer, on a project called “The Analytical Engine.” During this time, she was asked to translate Italian engineer Luigi Meneabrea’s lecture notes from French to English. She found many errors and expanded on the original in her footnotes.</p>

                <p>“The Analytical Engine has no pretentions whatever to originate anything,” she wrote in one of those footnotes. “It can do whatever we know how to order it to perform. It can follow analysis; but it has no power of anticipating any analytical relations or truths. Its province is to assist us in making available what we are already acquainted with.”</p>

                <p>Thanks to those notes on the engine, Lovelace is now widely recognized as the first computer programmer.</p>

                <div class="title">Edith Clarke (1883 - 1959)</div>
                <div class="content">
                <p>Edith Clarke created and patented The Clarke Calculator, a graphical device that solved equations used to send power through electrical transmission lines longer than 250 meters. Her massive contribution to transcontinental telephone communication silenced skeptics. In 1922, at 38, Edith Clarke became the first professional female electrical engineer.</p>

                <div class="title">Women of ENIAC (1946)</div>
                <div class="content">
                <p>ENIAC's six primary programmers, Betty Jennings, Kay McNulty, Betty Snyder, Marlyn Meltzer, Fran Bilas, Ruth Lichterman, not only determined how to input ENIAC programs, but also developed an understanding of ENIAC's inner workings. The programmers debugged problems by crawling inside the massive structure to find bad joints and bad tubes.</p>

                <div class="title">Grace Hopper (1906-1992)</div>
                <div class="content">
                <p>Grace Hopper was a computer scientist, Yale Ph.D, and United States Navy Rear Admiral who also—on top of everything else—helped pioneer computer programming. During her illustrious career, Hopper worked on UNIVAC I, the first commercial computer produced in the U.S., and created the first compiler. She is also credited with coining the term “computer bug” when she found a real moth inside the massive UNIVAC I. If that wasn’t enough, Hopper also invented FLOW-MATIC, the first English-like data processing language, which helped spark the development of COBOL, which eventually became the Navy’s standard operating language.</p>

                <div class="title"><a href="http://google.com">Evelyn Boyd Granville (1924- )</a></div>
                <div class="content">
                <p>Granville attended Smith College and then Yale for her Ph.D, becoming just the second African American women to receive a mathematics doctorate at any American University. After a few years of teaching at Fisk University, an all-black college in Nashville, Granville began her professional career performing real-time’ calculations for satellite launchings. She studied rocket trajectories and methods of orbit computation as a part of the U.S. involvement in the space race.</p>

                <div class="title">Sister Mary Kenneth Keller (1913-1985)</div>
                <div class="content">
                <p>Became first woman to receive a Ph.D in Computer Science. She played a significant role developing a key computer language: Beginner’s All-Puprose Symbolic Instruction Code, or BASIC. Thanks to BASIC, writing custom software was no longer restricted to mathematicians and scientists. Her contribution made computer use much more accessible to a broader portion of the population.</p>

                <div class="title">Carol Shaw (1955- )</div>
                <div class="content">
                <p>Shaw programmed one of the Atari’s best-known shooter games, River Raid. For the first time, gamers could experience an inordinate amount of non-random, repeating terrain despite constrictive memory limits. River Raid was the first game that allowed the shooter to accelerate and slow down all over the screen.</p>
